# Credential Stuffing

**Credential Stuffing** is an automated attack that uses lists of usernames and passwords from a previous data breach to try and gain access to other, unrelated services.

## How It Works

1.  **Breach**: A website or service is compromised, and its user database (containing usernames and passwords) is stolen.
2.  **Automation**: Attackers take this list and use bots to systematically "stuff" these credentials into the login forms of many other popular websites (e.g., banking, email, social media).
3.  **Success Condition**: The attack succeeds because many people reuse the same password across multiple websites. If a user's credentials from the breached site are the same as their credentials on a target site, the attacker gains access.

**Example**: If you used the same password for a gaming forum that was breached and for your email account, an attacker can use the leaked password from the forum to log into your email.

## How to Protect Yourself

The single most effective defense against credential stuffing is to **use a unique password for every single account.**

*   If you are not reusing passwords, a breach on one site does not put your other accounts at risk.
*   Using a **Password Manager** is the most effective way to create and manage unique, strong passwords for all of your accounts.
