# Credential Stuffing (The Brute Force)

Credential Stuffing is an Automated Attack. It relies on the fact that people often reuse the same password across multiple websites.

    How it works: Attackers take a list of leaked usernames and passwords (from a past data breach, like a LinkedIn or Adobe leak) and use automated bots to "stuff" those credentials into the login pages of other popular sites (like Amazon, Netflix, or GitHub).

The Goal: To see which accounts they can break into using the stolen data.

Example: If your password for a random gaming forum was leaked in 2023, a bot will try that same email/password combo on your Gmail and Bank accounts automatically.
