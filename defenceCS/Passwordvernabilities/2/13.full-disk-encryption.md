# Full-Disk Encryption

Full-disk encryption or encryption at rest entirely encrypts the content of your hard drive.
If your device is stolen or you sell your device, no one will have access to your encrypted data.
However, a downside is that if you lose your password or your face changes enough, you will not have access to your data.
Another downside is that hackers may use this same type of technology through ransomware to encrypt your hard drive and hold it hostage.
