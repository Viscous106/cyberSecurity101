# Deletion

When you "delete" a file on your computer, you might think it's gone for good. However, in most cases, the file is not actually erased from your hard drive. Instead, the operating system simply removes the pointer to the file, marking the space it occupies as "available" to be used by new data.

## Data Remanence

This phenomenon is known as **data remanence**. The actual data of the "deleted" file remains on the storage device until it is overwritten by new data. This means that, with the right tools, it's often possible to recover deleted files.

Data remanence can be a significant security risk. If you sell or dispose of a computer without properly wiping the hard drive, your sensitive data could be recovered by someone else.

## Secure Deletion Methods

To permanently delete a file and make it unrecoverable, you need to use a secure deletion method. Here are some of the most common methods:

*   **Overwriting (Data Wiping):** This is the most common method of secure deletion. It involves writing a pattern of ones and zeros over the entire file, effectively scrambling the original data. This can be done multiple times to make it even more difficult to recover the original data.
*   **Degaussing:** This method is used for magnetic storage media, like traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). It involves exposing the drive to a powerful magnetic field, which disrupts the magnetic domains on the drive and erases the data.
*   **Physical Destruction:** The most extreme method of secure deletion is to physically destroy the storage device. This can be done by shredding, incinerating, or pulverizing the device.

## Special Considerations for SSDs

It's important to note that secure deletion on Solid-State Drives (SSDs) is more complex than on traditional HDDs. SSDs use a technology called "wear leveling" to distribute writes evenly across the drive, which can make it difficult to ensure that a file has been overwritten. For this reason, the best way to securely delete data from an SSD is often to use the "Secure Erase" command that is built into the drive's firmware, or to encrypt the entire drive and then discard the key.

## Measures to Take for Secure Deletion

1.  **Use Secure Deletion Software:** Use a secure deletion tool to overwrite your files before you delete them. Many operating systems have built-in tools for this (e.g., `cipher /w` in Windows, `shred` in Linux), and there are also many third-party tools available.
2.  **Wipe Your Hard Drive Before Disposing of It:** Before you sell or dispose of a computer, be sure to wipe the hard drive using a secure deletion method.
3.  **Encrypt Your Files:** Encrypting your files before you delete them can add an extra layer of security. Even if a file is recovered, it will be unreadable without the encryption key.
4.  **Consider Full-Disk Encryption:** Encrypting your entire hard drive is a good way to protect your data from being recovered after deletion.
5.  **Physically Destroy Drives Containing Highly Sensitive Data:** For highly sensitive data, physical destruction of the storage device is the only way to be 100% sure that the data is unrecoverable.
