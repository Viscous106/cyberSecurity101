# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is an emerging computer technology that may be able to provide exponential computing power to adversaries.
This technology may be used by adversaries to cut down on the time required to guess passwords and break encryption.
Hopefully, we will have access to such computing power before bad actors do.
