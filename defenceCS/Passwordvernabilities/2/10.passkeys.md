# Passkeys

Passkeys are a new, more secure, and easier-to-use replacement for passwords. They are a form of passwordless authentication that allows you to sign in to websites and apps without having to enter a username and password.

Passkeys are based on the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standards, which are developed by a consortium of tech companies, including Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

## How Passkeys Work

Passkeys use public-key cryptography to authenticate you. Here's a simplified explanation of how they work:

1.  **Creating a Passkey:** When you create a passkey for a website or app, your device generates a pair of cryptographic keys: a **public key** and a **private key**.
    *   The **public key** is sent to the website or app and stored on their servers.
    *   The **private key** is securely stored on your device (e.g., in the Secure Enclave on an iPhone or the Titan M chip on a Pixel phone).
2.  **Signing In:** When you want to sign in, the website or app sends a "challenge" to your device.
3.  **Authentication:** Your device uses the private key to "sign" the challenge and sends the signed challenge back to the website or app. You typically approve this with a biometric authentication (like Face ID or a fingerprint scan) or your device's PIN.
4.  **Verification:** The website or app uses your public key to verify the signature. If the signature is valid, you are logged in.

The key thing to understand is that your private key never leaves your device. This is what makes passkeys so secure.

## Passkeys vs. Passwords

Passkeys offer several significant advantages over passwords:

*   **Phishing-Resistant:** Because your private key never leaves your device, it's impossible for an attacker to phish it from you.
*   **No More Weak Passwords:** Passkeys are always strong and unique, so you don't have to worry about creating and remembering complex passwords.
*   **No More Password Reuse:** Each passkey is unique to a specific website or app, so there's no risk of a data breach at one site compromising your accounts on other sites.
*   **Easier to Use:** Signing in with a passkey is typically faster and easier than typing a password.

## Passkey Adoption

Passkey adoption is growing rapidly. Many major websites and apps now support passkeys, including:

*   Google
*   Apple
*   Microsoft
*   PayPal
*   eBay
*   and many more.

As more and more services adopt passkeys, they are likely to become the standard way we sign in to websites and apps.

## Measures to Take for Secure Passkey Use

1.  **Keep Your Devices Secure:** The security of your passkeys depends on the security of your devices. Be sure to use a strong PIN or password to protect your devices, and keep your operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2.  **Enable Passkey Syncing:** Most major platforms (Apple, Google, Microsoft) offer a way to sync your passkeys across your devices. This is a convenient way to use your passkeys on all your devices, and it also provides a backup in case you lose one of your devices.
3.  **Be Aware of a New Type of Phishing:** While passkeys are resistant to traditional phishing attacks, attackers may try to trick you into creating a passkey for a malicious website. Be sure to only create passkeys for websites that you know and trust.
4.  **Have a Recovery Plan:** If you lose all of your devices, you may need a way to recover your accounts. Be sure to set up a recovery method for your accounts, such as a recovery email address or phone number.
