# Salting

Salting is a crucial security technique used to protect passwords. It involves adding a unique, random string of characters, known as a "salt," to each password before it is hashed. The primary purpose of salting is to make it more difficult for attackers to crack passwords, even if they manage to steal the database of hashed passwords.

## How Salting Works

1.  **Generate a Unique Salt:** When a user creates an account or changes their password, a unique, random salt is generated for that user.
2.  **Combine Salt and Password:** The salt is combined with the user's plaintext password.
3.  **Hash the Combination:** The combined salt and password string is then passed through a hashing algorithm (like Argon2, bcrypt, or Scrypt).
4.  **Store the Salt and Hash:** Both the salt and the resulting hash are stored in the database, associated with the user's account. The original plaintext password is never stored.

When the user logs in, the system retrieves the salt from the database, combines it with the password the user entered, and hashes the combination. If the resulting hash matches the one stored in the database, the user is authenticated.

## Benefits of Salting

*   **Defeats Rainbow Table Attacks:** Rainbow tables are pre-computed lists of hashes for common passwords. Because each password has a unique salt, even two users with the same password will have different hashes. This makes rainbow tables ineffective.
*   **Mitigates Dictionary and Brute-Force Attacks:** Without salting, an attacker could hash a list of common passwords (a dictionary) and compare the results to all the hashes in a stolen database. With salting, the attacker must hash each password guess with each user's unique salt, making the process much slower and more computationally expensive.
*   **Prevents Duplicate Hash Detection:** Salting ensures that even if multiple users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different. This prevents an attacker from identifying users with weak or common passwords by looking for duplicate hashes.

## Measures to Take for Secure Salting

1.  **Use a Unique Salt for Every Password:** Never use the same salt for multiple passwords. A new, unique salt should be generated for each user's password.
2.  **Use a Sufficiently Long Salt:** A salt should be long enough to ensure its uniqueness. A common recommendation is to use a salt that is at least as long as the output of the hash function (e.g., 32 bytes for SHA-256).
3.  **Use a Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator:** Salts should be generated using a secure random number generator to ensure they are unpredictable.
4.  **Store the Salt with the Hash:** The salt is not a secret and can be stored in the database alongside the hash. It's essential for verifying the password.
5.  **Use a Modern, Slow Hashing Algorithm:** The security of salting is directly tied to the strength of the hashing algorithm. Always use a slow, adaptive hashing algorithm like **Argon2**, **bcrypt**, or **Scrypt**, which are designed for password hashing and often have built-in salting mechanisms.

By implementing these salting best practices, you can add a powerful layer of defense to your password storage system and significantly reduce the risk of password-related breaches.
