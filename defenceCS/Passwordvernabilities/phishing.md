# Phishing (The Bait)

Phishing is a form of Social Engineering. The goal is to trick a human into giving up sensitive information voluntarily.

    How it works: An attacker sends a fake email, text (smishing), or makes a call (vishing) pretending to be a trusted source (like your bank, Google, or even your college).

The Goal: To get you to click a link and enter your username and password on a fake login page.

Example: You get an email saying "Your SST account password expired, click here to reset." You enter your credentials on a fake site, and now the hacker has them.
