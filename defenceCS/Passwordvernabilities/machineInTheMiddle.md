# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** is a type of cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. The attacker effectively "sits in the middle" of the conversation, allowing them to eavesdrop, alter, or inject malicious content into the communication without either party being aware.

## How a MITM Attack Works:

The core principle of a MITM attack involves the attacker positioning themselves between the user and the application or server they are trying to communicate with.

1.  **Interception**: The attacker first intercepts the communication between the two parties. This can happen in various ways, such as setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point, poisoning network caches, or compromising a router.
2.  **Impersonation**: Once in the middle, the attacker impersonates both parties. To the user, the attacker appears to be the legitimate server (e.g., a bank's website). To the legitimate server, the attacker appears to be the user.
3.  **Relay and Manipulation**: The attacker relays messages back and forth, decrypting them if necessary, reading or modifying them, and then re-encrypting them before sending them to the intended recipient. Both parties remain unaware that their communication is being compromised.

## Common Types of MITM Attacks:

*   **Wi-Fi Eavesdropping**: Attackers set up fake (rogue) Wi-Fi access points that mimic legitimate ones (e.g., "Free Airport Wi-Fi"). Users connect to the rogue AP, and all their traffic passes through the attacker.
*   **ARP Spoofing (ARP Poisoning)**: In a local network, an attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device (like the router or another computer). This redirects traffic through the attacker's machine.
*   **DNS Spoofing (DNS Cache Poisoning)**: Attackers inject false DNS entries into a DNS server's cache. When a user tries to visit a legitimate website, their request is redirected to a malicious website controlled by the attacker.
*   **HTTPS Spoofing/SSL Stripping**: While HTTPS is designed to encrypt communication, attackers can degrade a secure connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection without the user's knowledge (SSL stripping). They can also present a fake SSL certificate to the user, intercepting encrypted traffic.
*   **Session Hijacking**: After a user has authenticated with a legitimate server, an attacker steals the session cookie or token, allowing them to take over the session without needing to know the user's credentials.

## Why MITM Attacks are Dangerous:

MITM attacks can lead to:
*   Theft of sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, personal data).
*   Injection of malicious code or content into web pages.
*   Manipulation of online transactions.
*   Identity theft.

## How to Protect Yourself from MITM Attacks:

1.  **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure websites use HTTPS (indicated by a padlock icon in the browser). Be suspicious if a site defaults to HTTP or if you see certificate warnings.
2.  **Verify Website Certificates**: Check the SSL/TLS certificate details of sensitive websites to ensure they are legitimate and issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.
3.  **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured and easily exploited for MITM attacks. If you must use them, use a reputable Virtual Private Network (VPN).
4.  **Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection, creating a secure tunnel between your device and the VPN server. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to intercept or decipher your traffic.
5.  **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your operating system, web browsers, and all applications are kept up-to-date. Software updates often include patches for vulnerabilities that MITM attackers might exploit.
6.  **Be Wary of Suspicious Links/Emails**: Phishing attacks can lead you to compromised sites or download malware that facilitates MITM.
7.  **Disable Auto-Connect to Wi-Fi**: Configure your devices not to automatically connect to unknown or open Wi-Fi networks.
8.  **Network Monitoring**: For organizations, implement network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns that might indicate an ARP spoofing or other MITM attack.
