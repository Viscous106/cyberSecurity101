# Keylogging

**Keylogging** is a type of surveillance attack where malicious software (malware) is installed on a computer to record every keystroke the user makes.

## The Threat

An attacker who successfully installs a keylogger can capture everything you type, including:
*   Usernames and passwords
*   Credit card numbers
*   Private messages
*   One-Time Passwords (OTPs)

This makes it a dangerous threat that can bypass even strong passwords.

## How to Protect Yourself

*   **Use Trusted Devices**: The most important defense is to only log in to sensitive accounts on devices that you control and know are secure. Avoid using public or shared computers for important tasks.
*   **Use Anti-Malware Software**: Keep reputable security software running and updated. Regularly scan your system to detect and remove keyloggers and other malware.
*   **MFA is Still a Strong Defense**: Even if a keylogger captures your password, it cannot defeat a strong second factor on a separate, uninfected device. For example, the attacker can't intercept the code from an authenticator app running on your phone if your computer is the one that's infected.
*   **Be Cautious of Downloads**: Be wary of downloading software from untrusted sources or opening suspicious email attachments, as these are common ways keyloggers are installed.
