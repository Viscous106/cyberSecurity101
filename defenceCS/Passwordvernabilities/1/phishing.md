# Phishing

**Phishing** is a technological form of **Social Engineering**. The goal is to trick you into voluntarily giving up sensitive information by posing as a trusted source.

## How It Works

An attacker sends a fraudulent message, typically an email (phishing), a text message (smishing), or a voice call (vishing). This message is designed to look like it's from a legitimate entity, such as your bank, a tech company like Google, or your workplace.

The message will often contain a link that directs you to a fake website that looks identical to the real one (e.g., a perfect copy of the Google login page). When you enter your username and password on this fake page, the attacker captures them.

**Example**: You receive an email claiming "Your account has been suspended, click here to verify your identity." You are taken to a fake login page, and the attackers steal your credentials when you try to log in.

## How to Protect Yourself

*   **Never blindly trust links in emails or messages.** Even if an email looks legitimate, be suspicious of links.
*   **Go directly to the source.** The safest method is to open a new browser window and manually type the trusted URL (e.g., `bankofamerica.com`, `google.com`) yourself. This ensures you are on the real website and not a fake one.
*   **Check for HTTPS and certificate details**, but be aware that sophisticated attackers can now create fake sites with valid-looking certificates. The "go directly" method is safer.
