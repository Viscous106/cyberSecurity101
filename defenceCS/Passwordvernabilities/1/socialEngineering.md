# Social Engineering

**Social Engineering** is a type of attack that relies on human interaction and manipulation rather than purely technological exploits. The goal is to use social pressure and trust to trick a person into compromising their own security.

## How It Works

An attacker using social engineering will often:
*   **Pose as a Trusted Party**: They might pretend to be from tech support, your bank, or a government agency.
*   **Create a Sense of Urgency or Fear**: They might claim your account has been compromised or that you will lose access to it if you don't act now.
*   **Exploit Trust**: They build a rapport or use information they've found about you to seem legitimate.
*   **Gather Personal Details**: They may try to get details about your life (e.g., your pet's name, mother's maiden name, first car) that are commonly used as answers to security questions.

The ultimate goal is to convince you to voluntarily give up sensitive information, such as your password, financial details, or other credentials.

**Phishing** is one of the most common forms of social engineering.
